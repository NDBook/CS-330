Comp Graphic and Visualizations

1. How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new design skills that I developed during the project were all the concepts introduced throughout the course.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
This is the first time using OpenGL, so I followed the OpenGL website tutorials and made adjustments according to the chosen scene.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Now that I have the building blocks to replicate a 2D picture in a 3D digital environment, I will be able to resuse them and build upon them as I develop more in-depth skills. 

2. How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

How did iteration factor into your development?

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?


3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

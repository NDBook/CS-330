Comp Graphic and Visualizations

1. How do I approach designing software?
o What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new design skills that my work on the project helped me craft is creating 3D screens in general. I never created a 3D scene using OpenGL before and throughout the project milestones and assignments, I believe that it has greatly assisted with my development in 2D/3D design.

o What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process I followed for my project was taking a photo of the objects I was wanting to create in a 3D render space. After taking the photo, I then designed my project in segments by the techniques learned that current week instead of tackling the project all at once.

o How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I believe that the tactics I used for my design approach are very universal and I will be able to apply them to future work. One tactic is cutting up the work into segments and working on one to completion before beginning the next to prevent any confusion or potential issues.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
o What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on my 3D scene one of the new development strategies that I used was visualizing my 3D scene because before the reference photo was taken and continue to visualize how I will create those objects into a 3D scene. I spent a lot of time experimenting with the placement of the shapes, texture, lighting on each object.

o How did iteration factor into your development?
Iterations factored in greatly of the development of this project. There was plenty of trial and error since OpenGL was entirely new to me. I was able to figure out the parts' interaction better with each iteration.

o How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I found that with each milestone, the new content really helped solidify on what I had learned. It also allowed me to go back and tidy up some of the messier code created before, making it more readable and efficient. Going through the milestones each week and completing them overall assisted me greatly with the project's completion

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
The computational graphics and visualizations knowledge and skills that I was given throughout this course can be useful with future projects. The visualization will be a significant help throughout the development process.
